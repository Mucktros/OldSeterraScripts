##  How to Use These Scripts
**Paste it in the console.**  

### Things to Note:  
- These scripts **only work for Seterra on the Wayback Machine (Old Seterra).**  
- **Fast click will break "Place the Labels" (PTL) and "Place the Flags" (PTF).**
- **Show Next** is kinda buggy, because it looks for ideas that have **AREA_name** for the elements, if you find quizes that dont work because of this, please let me know on discord (mucktros).
